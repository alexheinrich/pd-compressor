/**
 * @brief stp_comp
 * Feedforward dynamic range compressor.The detector is placed in the log domain after
 * the gain computer, since this generates a smooth envelope, has no attack lag, and allows for easy implementation of variable knee width.
 * For the compressor to have smooth performance on a wide variety of signals, with minimal artifacts and minimal modification
 * of timbral characteristics, the smooth, decoupled peak detector design has been used.
 *
 * Algorithms have been taken from:
 * Giannoulis, Dimitrios & Massberg, Michael & Reiss, Joshua. (2012). Digital Dynamic Range Compressor Designâ€”A Tutorial and Analysis. AES: Journal of the Audio Engineering Society. 60.
