 the gain computer, since this generates a smooth envelope, has no attack lag, and allows ~\newline
 for easy implementation of variable knee width. For the compressor to have smooth performance on a wide ~\newline
 variety of signals, with minimal artifacts and minimal modification of timbral characteristics, ~\newline
 the smooth, decoupled peak detector design has been used. ~\newline
